abstract: >
  CR-SSCP is a research prototype of a persistent, self-regulating AI process
  built around coherence, attention, memory, and predictive dynamics.
  It transforms a reactive LLM into a continuous cognitive loop with internal drives,
  temporal binding, and active inference in a simulated environment
  to explore functional candidate consciousness dynamics.
