# CR-SSCP
CR-SSCP is a research prototype of a persistent, self-regulating AI process built around coherence, attention, memory, and prediction. It transforms an LLM from a reactive tool into a continuous cognitive loop with internal drives, temporal binding, and active inference in a simulated world to explore functional “candidate consciousness” dynamics.
