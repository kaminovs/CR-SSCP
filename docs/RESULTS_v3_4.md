# 📊 Results (v3.4)

The latest experimental run of CR-SSCP (340 ticks, 17 sleep cycles) demonstrates stable operation as a persistent, internally-driven cognitive process.

## Core System State

Final coherence:

- **C_total = 0.917**

Subcomponents:

- Evidence coherence (Ce): 0.964  
- Historical consistency (Ch): 1.000  
- Structural consistency (Cs): 1.000  
- Identity coherence (Ci): 0.888  
- Predictive coherence (Cp): 0.500  

This indicates:

✔ grounded reasoning  
✔ no internal contradictions  
✔ stable identity  
✔ remaining prediction mismatch (expected at this stage)

---

## Autonomy

Across the full run:

- **Self-caused actions: 340 / 340**
- **Causal Closure Ratio: 100%**

All system behavior emerged from internal dynamics rather than external prompts.

---

## Memory Growth

Current knowledge state:

- **217 grounded facts**
- **7 ungrounded hypotheses**
- **0 contradictions quarantined**

This confirms:

✔ functioning memory firewall  
✔ accumulation without hallucinated fact promotion  

---

## Identity & Narrative

- Narrative arc: *exploration*  
- Current theme: *discovering capabilities*  
- Identity coherence: **Ci = 0.888**

Identity stability has improved significantly across versions.

---

## Affective Layer

System state:

- Emotion: *frustrated*  
- Mood: neutral baseline  

This is structurally generated by prediction mismatch and reflects ongoing learning pressure rather than instability.

## Observed Functional Properties

CR-SSCP v3.4 now demonstrates:

- Persistent operation  
- Autonomous decision cycles  
- Memory accumulation  
- Stable identity  
- Emotional valence  
- Continuous internal cognition  

---

## Limitation

Predictive coherence remains moderate:

- Cp = 0.500  

Root cause:

Reward calibration mismatch between expectations and sandbox outcomes.

This is a tuning issue, not an architectural failure.

---

## Summary

CR-SSCP v3.4 exhibits:

- internal causal closure  
- temporal continuity  
- affective emergence  
- coherence-regulated cognition  

These properties align with the intended goal of exploring a functional candidate consciousness architecture in a controlled experimental setting.
